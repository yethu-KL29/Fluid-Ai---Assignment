# Key Investor Summary Generator

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered solution that extracts and summarizes key business information relevant to investors from a given document. The system uses OpenAI’s GPT model to generate a concise, structured summary, focusing on investor-specific insights across four primary sections:

1. **Future Growth Prospects**
2. **Key Changes in Business**
3. **Key Triggers**
4. **Material Effect on Next Year's Earnings and Growth**

The summary is generated in bullet points and focuses on providing only the most essential and relevant information for decision-making.
